Mars Documentation
=========================================

Mars is a tool based on Apache Airflow to interact with multiple data sources using Hive and HDFS. The main aim 
is to provide a framework to import data into a single data lake, perform necessary computations and store the
result in a data store of your choice!

Mars was initially built explicity to work with the schema present in Snowplow Analytics, but it's extensibility
ensures that adding new modules is a breeze!

Features
========

- **Diverse Sources**: Interact and import data from a variety of sources such as MySQL, Postgres, S3 using tools such as
  Sqoop and Hive.
- **SQL**: The core of mars is based on supporting queries using HiveQL, which is very similar to SQL.
- **Dynamic DAGs**: DAGs defined with paramters are automatically split into smaller and more modular tasks, allowing you to work with
  large amounts of data.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor all your tasks with notifications on your favorite apps such as Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
